 * ## 只写环境，不写方法论
 *
 * 设计稿的原则是「盒子不管脑子，只管手脚和环境」。所以这里只说三类事实：
 * 交付标准是什么（这是用户的要求）、手上有哪些团队工具、有哪些物理限制
 * （编辑器只有一台、只在新工程里干）。**岗位怎么分、流程怎么走、先做什么，
 * 一个字都不写** —— 写了就是替模型做它本来做得更好的决定，还把它锁死在我们
 * 想得到的题材里。
 *
 * 往这里加规则之前，先去设计稿附录的规则台账记一笔：翻车现象是什么、
 * 这条规则防的是哪一次。
 *
 * 英文，和 `buildSystemPrompt` 一致；回复语言由那边的语言准则决定。

 * 自动曝光会把压暗的场景再拉亮，视口、截图、游戏各自收敛到不同的地方，
